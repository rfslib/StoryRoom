# StoryRoom

This repository contains the code for the Story Room at the Riverton FamilySearch Library.

## Purpose

The Story Room is a sound-proofed room where people can record a one-hour video. The format usually involved an interviewee who is asked various questions about his or her life by an interviewer.

## Technical Componenets

* PTZ camera
* ceiling-mounted microphones feeding into a automixer
* computer
* Two monitor (one for the monitor, one for control)
* Windows 10 as the OS
* OBS Studio to do the recording
* OBS web ???
* Python as the controlling program

Note that OBS Studio allows internal scripting with Python, but that it was substantially more complex to do the controlling and on-screen display. There is still some internal scripting to automate some things.
